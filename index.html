  <h1>Hello all and welcome!</h1>

  <p>This page dedicated to running, obstacle racing, and general fitness!</p>

  <p>This site is a work in progress and I will be updating both the content as well as the structure of the site as I learn more about web design.  To start with there will be pics and videos from a handfull of races I have taken part in over the past few years as well as links to sistes that I have found useful.</p>

  <p>Here are a couple links to races I have took part in:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="toughmudder_2014/toughmudder_info.html">Tough Mudder, 2014 Tahoe</a></li>
      <li><a href="spartin_beast_2015/spartin_beast_info.html">Spartin Beast, 2015 Tahoe</a></li>
      <li><a href="thy_marathon_2016/thy_marathon_info.html">Thy Trail Marathon, 2016 Denmark</a></li>
